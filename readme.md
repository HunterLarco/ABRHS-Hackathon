# HackAB

> HackAB is Acton-Boxborough's two day hackathon. Students will learn how to program and use their talents to build, create, and innovate. Our focus is to give students a window into the ever-growing field of technology at any technical level, making it an excellent learning opportunity for both the new and experienced.
